# Online Retail Segmentation
The report contains a detailed analysis of online retail data for the purpose of inferring customer behavior and product trends. 
The source dataset has been restricted to the region of the United Kingdom and spans over a period of 1 year from 2010 to 2011. 
The analysis has been carried out using the k-means algorithm and the customer and product data have been segmented into 4 respectively. 
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow plot. 
A certain degree of parity and homogeneity can be deduced from customers and products of a particular segment. 
A summary of the findings is documented below:
